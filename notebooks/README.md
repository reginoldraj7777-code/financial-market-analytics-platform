# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used during the development of the Financial Market Analytics Platform.

## Purpose

These notebooks were used for:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Technical indicator feature engineering
- Time-series feature creation
- SQL result validation
- Chart prototyping before dashboard integration
- Metric verification and sanity checks

## Typical Workflow

1. Load raw stock datasets
2. Perform exploratory analysis and summary statistics
3. Engineer indicators (moving averages, beta, volatility)
4. Validate computed metrics against SQL outputs
5. Prototype visualizations
6. Finalize features for dashboard layer

## Note

Notebooks are used for experimentation and validation.  
Production-ready logic is implemented in the `src/` scripts.
